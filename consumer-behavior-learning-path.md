Perfect! Here’s a **fully integrated, realistic learning path** for you — focused on **consumer behavior analytics**, beginner → applied statistics, business finance, and insight generation — structured around your work/home setup and designed so you can **start small, build mini-projects, and produce a finished portfolio**.

---

# ⭐ **CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYTICS LEARNING PATH (Integrated)**

---

## **PHASE 0 — GitHub Reset & Project Setup**

**Goal:** Start clean and structured.

- Delete/archive your old PM analytics repo.
- Create new repo: `consumer-behavior-analytics`
- Suggested structure:

```
consumer-behavior-analytics/
├─ data/            # Raw CSV/Excel datasets
├─ notebooks/       # Python/Jupyter notebooks
├─ sql/             # SQL queries
├─ outputs/         # Charts, dashboards, tables
└─ README.md        # Project explanation + insights
```

- Start small: a tiny dataset for your first mini-project (e.g., 1–2 weeks of sales data, or a small online retail dataset).

---

## **PHASE 1 — Foundations (1–2 weeks)**

### **1. Statistical Analytics (Beginner → Applied)**

**Goal:** Build confidence in core stats.

- Concepts: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, distributions, correlation, probability, sampling.
- Apply to consumer data: e.g., customer orders, product quantities, revenue.

**Mini-Projects:**

- Summarize sales by customer/product
- Identify outliers or unusual purchase patterns
- Correlation: e.g., order frequency vs. average order value

---

### **2. Business Finance Basics**

**Goal:** Learn finance through data you already have.

- Revenue, expenses, gross/net profit
- Contribution margin & break-even
- Budget vs actual, variance analysis
- ROI & simple profitability metrics

**Mini-Projects:**

- Revenue per product/customer segment
- Margin analysis for top-selling products
- Simple P&L summary using consumer dataset

---

### **3. Insight Generation Fundamentals**

**Goal:** Learn to turn data into actionable recommendations.

- Start with a business question: “What is the most profitable customer segment?”
- Explore the data: trends, anomalies, correlations
- Prioritize insights: what matters most to the business?

**Mini-Projects:**

- Identify top 3 actionable insights from a small dataset
- Draft implications and recommendations (1–3 bullets)

---

## **PHASE 2 — Analyst Tools & Applied Skills (3–4 weeks)**

### **Work Tasks (SQL + Python Online + Excel at Work)**

- SQL: aggregations, GROUP BY, JOINs, window functions, CASE statements
- Python: pandas for cleaning, grouping, plotting; matplotlib/plotly for visualizations
- Excel: formulas, PivotTables, KPI cards, quick dashboards

**Mini-Projects:**

- Top 5 customers by revenue
- Product sales trends over time
- Cohort analysis: repeat purchase patterns
- Visualizations + brief insights

---

### **Home Tasks (Full Project Building)**

- Dashboard construction: Excel / Python / Plotly
- Long-form analysis: multi-part insights (trend + finance + recommendation)
- GitHub documentation: README with context, methodology, insights

---

## **PHASE 3 — Insight Communication & Presentation (1–2 weeks)**

### **Executive vs Technical Presentation**

- **Executive:** charts, KPIs, concise bullets, recommendations
- **Technical:** methodology, formulas, SQL/Python snippets, assumptions

**Mini-Projects:**

- 1-slide executive insight summary
- 1-page technical explanation in Markdown/Jupyter notebook
- Update GitHub README with both formats

---

## **PHASE 4 — Layer Complexity / Advanced Analytics (Ongoing)**

- Multi-month dataset analysis (seasonality, trends, cohort)
- Campaign performance (if dataset has campaigns or promotions)
- Product profitability over time
- Advanced statistics: z-scores, simple regressions, correlations

**Mini-Projects:**

- Repeat customer analysis and retention insights
- Top-performing campaigns & recommendations
- Seasonal sales trends & forecasting

---

## **PHASE 5 — Portfolio & Job Readiness**

- Each mini-project → push to GitHub
- README clearly documents **dataset, question, analysis, insights, and recommendations**
- Combined portfolio demonstrates:

  1. **Stats + finance**
  2. **SQL/Python/Excel skills**
  3. **Insight generation**
  4. **Presentation skills (executive + technical)**

---

## **WORK / HOME / WEEKEND STRUCTURE**

| Location                               | Focus                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work (SQL + Python Online + Excel)** | Short exercises: summaries, queries, quick plots, mini-insights                                    |
| **Home**                               | Full mini-projects: dashboards, GitHub pushes, README updates, multi-step analysis                 |
| **Weekend Deep Work**                  | Combine multiple mini-projects → full pipeline: data → analysis → insights → presentation → GitHub |

---

### ✅ **Key Principles**

1. Start **small and finish** — each mini-project should be complete.
2. Build **mini-projects → full portfolio** progressively.
3. Always generate **1–3 actionable insights**.
4. Keep **executive and technical presentation** formats for every mini-project.
5. GitHub shows **progress and completion**, not abandoned ambition.

---

If you want, we can **start today with your first mini-project**: a **small consumer behavior dataset, basic stats, 1 insight, and a chart** — all pushable to GitHub.

Do you want to start that now?
